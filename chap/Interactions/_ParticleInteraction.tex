\chapter{Interactions of Radiaition in Matter}
\label{chap:Interaction}

In the field of neutron detection, understanding particles interactions with matter is essential. Knowing how and which interactions take place inside a detector makes it possible to predict its response to particles as well as interpreting its measurements of the radiation field.

For a gadolinium-based semiconductor neutron detector, particles of interest are first and foremost neutrons and secondly electrons and photons, reaction products of gadolinium-neutron capture. The following sections give an introduction to neutron, electron and photon interactions with matter, providing a ground understanding of the physics inside the neutron detector in question.
